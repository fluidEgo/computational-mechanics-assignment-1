Interactive Mechanics Solver
üìñ Overview

The Interactive Mechanics Solver is a web-based educational tool designed to help students practice and understand fundamental concepts in engineering mechanics. This single-page application generates a variety of physics problems with randomized values, providing endless opportunities for practice. For each problem, users can check their own answers or view a detailed, step-by-step solution.

This project was inspired by assignment questions from a university-level Computational Mechanics course, focusing on topics commonly found in introductory physics and engineering curricula. The problems cover 1D kinematics, forces on an inclined plane with friction, and the dynamics of circular motion.
‚ú® Features

    Dynamic Problem Generation: Never run out of practice questions. The "Generate New Problem" button creates a new version of the problem with different numerical values every time.

    Multiple Topics: The solver currently includes three distinct problem types:

        1D Kinematics: Solves for time, position, and acceleration based on a polynomial motion equation.

        Forces & Friction: Calculates the force required to accelerate a block up an inclined plane, considering gravity and kinetic friction.

        Circular Motion: Determines the velocity and total acceleration of a pendulum bob at a specific angle.

    Interactive SVG Diagrams: For visual learners, the friction and pendulum problems include dynamically generated diagrams that visually represent the problem's setup.

    Instant Feedback: Enter your calculated values into the input fields and click "Check Answer" to see if you are correct.

    Step-by-Step Solutions: If you're stuck, the "Show Solution" button reveals a comprehensive walkthrough, complete with formulas and calculations rendered using KaTeX for clarity.

    Clean & Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is easy to navigate and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

üöÄ How to Use

Since this is a self-contained HTML file, getting started is simple:

    Open the File: Download the mechanics_solver.html file.

    Launch in Browser: Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

    Select a Problem: Use the navigation menu on the left to choose a problem type (e.g., "1D Kinematics").

    Generate a Problem: Click the "Generate New Problem" button to load a question.

    Solve and Check: Work through the problem on your own. Enter your final answers in the corresponding input boxes and click "Check Answer" for immediate feedback.

    View Solution: If you need help, click the "Show Solution" button to see the detailed explanation.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    HTML: The core structure of the web page.

    Tailwind CSS: For styling and creating a responsive user interface.

    JavaScript: Powers all the application logic, including problem generation, calculations, and user interaction.

    KaTeX: A fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for rendering mathematical formulas and equations beautifully in the browser.

üìÇ File Structure

The entire project is contained within a single file for simplicity and portability:

    mechanics_solver.html: Contains the HTML structure, CSS styling (via Tailwind CDN and a <style> block), and all the JavaScript logic.

Enjoy your practice!
